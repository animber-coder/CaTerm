# Widget

Widgets are the main building block in CaTerm. Each Widget attempts to have a
single, well defined purpose. This can be to display the time, to take text
input and display what was typed, to be a pushable button, etc...

Widgets are the core of CaTerm, each application is built up of a hierarchy of
Widgets. [Layout](layouts.md) Widgets act as containers, grouping multiple
Widgets together into logical units. These Widgets and Layouts form a tree
structure that holds the entire application's UI state.

New Widget types can be created by inheriting from the `Widget` class and
overriding the event handler virtual functions.

See [Building with Existing Widgets](building-with-existing-widgets.md) and
[Creating New Widgets](creating-new-widgets.md).

## Cursor

The Cursor can be enabled or disabled for each Widget using the `Widget::cursor`
member object.

## Border

The Widget's border can be set by accessing the `Widget::border` member object.

## Name / ID

A name can be given to individual Widget objects via the `Widget::set_name(...)`
and `Widget::name()` methods. A unique ID is generated for each Widget object,
this is accessed via the `Widget::unique_id()` method.

## Widget Library

CaTerm tries to provide a set of common Widgets, these can be built upon by
inheriting from them and expanding their functionality.

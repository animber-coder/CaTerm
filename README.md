# Terminal User Interface Library

__CPPurses__ is a widget framework for NCurses inspired by Qt. It
comes from a desire for a simple and modern approach to building terminal
applications. Through a set of abstractions built on top of NCurses, CPPurses
enables quick development of complex TUIs, without getting in the way of
program logic.

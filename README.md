__CPPurses__ is a Qt inspired widget framework for NCurses, written in C++14. It
comes from a desire for a simple and modern approach to building terminal
applications. Through a set of abstractions built on top of NCurses, CPPurses
enables quick development of complex TUIs, without getting in the way of
program logic.

__Event System:__
Event loop, widget drawing, and user input.

__Signals and Slots:__
Widget to widget communication.

__Widget Library:__
Pre-made Widgets for reuse.

## Installation
CPPurses depends on two (header only)libraries I have created, this repo
includes them as git submodules. After cloning CPPurses, run
`git submodule update --init -- recursive`
to pull in the external libraries. Generated build files from CMake
will handle installation of each library and building of tests.

## Documentation
Doxygen documentation can be found [here](
https://animber-coder.github.io/CPPurses/).

## Tests
CPPurses uses google test and has support for ctest.

# Terminal User Interface Library

__CPPurses__ is a widget framework for NCurses inspired by Qt. It
comes from a desire for a simple and modern approach to building terminal
applications. Through a set of abstractions built on top of NCurses, CPPurses
enables quick development of complex TUIs, without getting in the way of
program logic.

## Installation
CPPurses depends on two (header only)libraries I have created, this repo
includes them as git submodules. After cloning CPPurses, run
`git submodule update --init -- recursive`
to pull in the external libraries. Generated build files from CMake
will handle installation of each library and building of tests.

## Documentation
Doxygen documentation can be found [here](
https://animber-coder.github.io/CPPurses/annotated.html).

## Tests
CPPurses uses google test and has support for ctest.
